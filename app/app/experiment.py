PostgreSQL Statistics Estimator - Experiment Module (Legacy Compatibility)

This module provides backward compatibility for the experiment functionality
that has been refactored into separate service modules. The ExperimentRunner
and related classes are now located in the services package for better
organization and maintainability.

Legacy imports are maintained for backward compatibility.
