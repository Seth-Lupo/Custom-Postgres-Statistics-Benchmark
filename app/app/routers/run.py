PostgreSQL Statistics Estimator - Main Router Module (Refactored)

This module serves as the main router aggregator that combines all the
specialized router modules. The original large router functionality has
been split into focused modules for better maintainability.

Router Modules:
- experiment_routes: Main experiment setup and submission
- configuration_routes: Configuration management (legacy)
- settings_config_routes: Settings and configuration management (new)
- streaming_routes: SSE streaming for real-time updates
- background_tasks: Background experiment execution
